#### Lab 2. Introduction to Classes and Objects.

#### Due Wed Sept 14.

To submit: Please check this lab back into your GitHib repo by the due date.

For this lab, please watch the accompanying video and work along with it.
We'll build two very simple classes: Dog and Cat. This will give you some exposure to how to create
basic classes and objects in Java, how to define and invoke methods, and how to write tests.

Task 1. Creating a class. Create the Dog and Cat class as described.

Task 2. Add member variables to the Cat class for name, breed, color and weight.

Task 3. Add a speak() method to the Cat class.

Task 4. Add a test to your main method to ensure that speak() works correctly.

Task 5. Add setters and getters to the Dog and Cat classes.

Task 6. Add two constructors to the Cat class. One should take just a name, the other all instance variables.

Task 7. Implement and test equals() for the Cat class.
